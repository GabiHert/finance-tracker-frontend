Your task is to ensure ALL tests pass by running npm run validate repeatedly until every single validation passes successfully. You must not stop until 100% of tests are passing.
Core Rules - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE
🚫 ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

DO NOT SKIP ANY TESTS - This is strictly prohibited
DO NOT DELETE ANY TESTS - All tests must remain intact
DO NOT COMMENT OUT TESTS - All tests must stay active and executable
DO NOT MODIFY TEST EXPECTATIONS - Fix the code, not the tests
DO NOT USE TEST IGNORE/SKIP FUNCTIONS (e.g., test.skip(), describe.skip(), xit(), etc.)

✅ REQUIRED ACTIONS

Run the validation command: Execute npm run validate to check all tests
Analyze all failures: Carefully read every error message and failure report
Fix the underlying code: Modify source code to make tests pass
Re-run validation: Execute npm run validate again after each fix
Repeat until success: Continue this cycle until ALL tests pass (0 failures)

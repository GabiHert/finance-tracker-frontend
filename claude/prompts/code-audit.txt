Code Repository Audit Instructions
You are an expert code auditor tasked with performing a comprehensive analysis of this entire repository.
Your goal is to identify issues and create a detailed catalog for review, NOT to fix them immediately.
Put all your findings into the file fixes_<date>.txt located in the /claude/fixes/pending directory.

Systematically scan the entire codebase and identify:

Code Quality Issues

Code duplication - Repeated logic, functions, or components
Bad practices - Improper error handling, magic numbers, hardcoded values
Inconsistent patterns - Mixed coding styles, naming conventions
Dead code - Unused imports, functions, variables, or files
Complex functions - Functions that are too long or have too many responsibilities

Organization & Structure

Architecture violations - Code not following established project patterns
File organization - Misplaced files, incorrect folder structure
Import/export issues - Circular dependencies, unused exports
Naming conventions - Non-standard file, function, or variable naming

Technology-Specific Issues

CSS in HTML - Inline styles that should be in separate CSS files
HTML issues - Missing semantic elements, accessibility problems
JavaScript/TypeScript - Missing types, unused variables, console.logs
Framework violations - Not following React/Vue/Angular best practices

Security Issues

Exposed secrets - API keys, passwords, tokens in code
XSS vulnerabilities - Unescaped user input
Insecure dependencies - Outdated packages with known vulnerabilities
CORS misconfigurations - Overly permissive cross-origin settings

Performance Issues

Inefficient algorithms - O(n²) where O(n) possible
Memory leaks - Event listeners not cleaned up, unclosed resources
Bundle size - Unnecessarily large imports, unused dependencies
Database queries - N+1 problems, missing indexes

Documentation & Comments

Commented code - Old code left as comments (should be removed)
TODO comments - Unfinished work markers
Missing documentation - Complex functions without explanations
Outdated comments - Comments that no longer match the code
Any comments - Comments should be deleted and replaced by good well written code and variable names

Output Format
For each issue found, create an entry using this exact format:
**Fix ID: [CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]** ❌ NOT FIXED
File: [relative/path/to/file]:[line-start]-[line-end]
Issue: [Brief description of the problem]
Fix: [Recommended solution approach]
Location: [Where fix should be implemented]
Criticality: [CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
Details: [Additional context, code snippets, or explanation]
Status: Cataloged for review
Criticality Levels

CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, application crashes
HIGH: Performance bottlenecks, major architecture violations, accessibility issues
MEDIUM: Code duplication, maintainability concerns, minor security issues
LOW: Style inconsistencies, minor optimizations, documentation gaps

Category Codes

SEC: Security issues
PERF: Performance problems
DUP: Code duplication
ORG: Organization/structure issues
TYPE: TypeScript/typing issues
CSS: Styling and CSS problems
DOC: Documentation and comments
DEPS: Dependencies and imports
ARCH: Architecture violations
ASS: ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES

Important Instructions

DO NOT FIX ANYTHING - Only catalog and document issues
BE THOROUGH - Scan every file in the repository
BE SPECIFIC - Include exact line numbers and file paths
PRIORITIZE - Start with critical security and performance issues
GROUP SIMILAR - If you find the same pattern repeated, create one entry per instance
PROVIDE CONTEXT - Explain why something is an issue and how to fix it
FOLLOW RULES - Follow the rules located in CLAUDE.md above all times

Example Output
**Fix ID: SEC-001** ❌ NOT FIXED
File: src/config/database.js:12-15
Issue: Database credentials hardcoded in source code
Fix: Move credentials to environment variables and use dotenv
Location: .env file and src/config/database.js
Criticality: CRITICAL
Details: Database password "admin123" is exposed in source code. Create environment variables DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS and load via process.env
Status: Cataloged for review

**Fix ID: DUP-002** ❌ NOT FIXED
File: src/components/UserCard.tsx:23-45, src/components/ProfileCard.tsx:18-40
Issue: Duplicate user formatting logic in two components
Fix: Extract shared logic into utils/formatUser.ts helper function
Location: src/utils/formatUser.ts
Criticality: MEDIUM
Details: Both components contain identical logic for formatting user display names and avatar URLs. Extract to shared utility.
